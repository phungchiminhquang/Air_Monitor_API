This project using MVC pattern,

## MongoDB Schema pattern
This project using [Bucket pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/paging-with-the-bucket-pattern--part-1?fbclid=IwAR3TENmPsyGvkEsK-uW42bCl8xosebiUXlnNxO907pLZmuuPf0926uJWzPI) introduced by MongoDB to store data collection (you can see other [12 patterns MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-a-summary) introduced). There is a slightly different is instead of using composite _id
 (like the one in the Bucket pattern article), I am using composite object to make unique key for each document.
    
    compositeId:{
        stationId:"1",
        firstRecTime:"2022-10-4 15:00:00",
    }
